# xnap-2.0: Explain LSTM-Models by Using LRP

## General
- Research goal:  Generate reliable explanations for LSTM-based next activity predictions

## Modes of xnap-2.0

1. Training/testing models 

2. Create single explanation

3. Evaluate explanations

## Research questions

1. Does an LSTM outperform an traditional ml algorithm (such as RF) in terms of predictive quality?
2. Does a model-specific post-hoc method generate more reliable explanations for an LSTM than a model-agnostic post-hoc method?
3. Does a model-specific post-hoc method generate explanations for an LSTM more efficiently than a model-agnostic post-hoc method?    
 
## Setting
- Prediction task: nap
- Data attributes: yes
- Data sets: helpdesk, bpi2019 (sample), and bpi2020
- Metrics: auc_roc, accuracy, precision (weighted), recall (weighted), f1-score (weighted)
- Machine learning models: Bi-LSTM, RandomForest, and Decision Tree
- Encoding: one-hot (activity and data attributes)
- Validation: 
    - split data set into train (80%) and test (20%); 
    - split train set (80%) into sub-train set (90%) and validation set (10%). 
- HPO: no (later yes)
- Shuffling: no
- Seed: 1377 (randomly selected, later no)
- Baseline: 
    - Bi-LSTM + LIME
    - Bi-LSTM + Shap
    - RF + LIME (optional)
    - RF + Shap (optional)


## Further details
- Ensuring reproducible results via a seed flag in config. Four seeds are set (holds only for cpu):
    - np.random.seed(1377)
    - tf.random.set_seed(1377)
    - random.seed(1377)
    - optuna.samplers.TPESampler(1377)
